# Tower Defense Game 
## Overview:
  This project is a tower defense game built in Unity using C#. It challenges players to make strategic decisions to place towers effectively based on the enemyâ€™s path. The game combines traditional tower defense mechanics with AI-based pathfinding for enemies and an educational twist where players solve math problems to earn points. Points can be used to build and upgrade towers, making it a fun and educational experience. 

## Key Features
### AI-Based Enemy Pathfinding: 
    Enemies navigate the grid using pathfinding algorithms to find the optimal path to the target.
### Math Problems Integration:
      Players solve math challenges during gameplay.
      Problems are divided into:
      - Easy: Rewards fewer points.
      - Medium: Rewards moderate points.
      - Hard: Rewards maximum points.
     Correct solutions help players earn points to place or upgrade towers.
### Dynamic Tower Placement and Firing:
    Towers are placed on valid zones (can be dragged and dropped) and fire projectiles at enemies in range.
    Projectiles deal damage based on the tower's attributes.
### Resource and Health Management:
    Balance (points) and health are dynamically updated in the UI.
    Buttons for towers disable when the player cannot afford a tower.
### Interactive UI:
    Math problems, balance, and health are displayed in real-time.
    Buttons reflect availability based on the player's balance.
